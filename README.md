# truyum-ui app

## How to run the app ?
Please feel free to run the app the way you prefer. 
I'll recommend though to run it via serve. 

You can install serve via npm (command bellow)

```console
foo@bar:~$ npm i -g serve
```

Once done, to run the static app type the command:
```console
foo@bar:~$ serve
```
